# RescueReady

The Disaster Management System (DMS) is designed to mitigate the impact of calamities by enabling swift and efficient responses. This model employs a network of sensors to detect and monitor floods, earthquakes, and fires in real-time.

## Key Features:

**Sensor Network:**
- HC-SR04 (Vibration Sensor)
- SW-420 (Water Level Sensor)
- IR Flame Sensor

**Data Collection & Detection:**
- Flood sensors monitor water levels and flow rates.
- Earthquake sensors detect seismic activity.
- Fire sensors use infrared imaging detection.

**Real-Time Alerts:** Automatic notifications to authorities and responders for rapid response.

**Fire Detection:** Implemented using OpenCV for real-time monitoring.

**Processor:** ESP8266 microcontroller.
